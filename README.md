# SV Basic Manual - Resurrected
A classic monospaced font by Johan Winge, modernized for programming.

## Origins
I was reading an old visual basic manual some time ago. I couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful monospaced font they were using for the code excerpts. So I put it through some font recognition app and somehow found the source.

The talented author of the font, Johan Winge seems to have worked on the font quite some time ago! You can still [view his webpage courtesy of WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20120130174357/http://home.student.uu.se/j/jowi4905/fonts/svbasicmanual.html)

There were a couple of glyphs missing - I was able to manipulate pieces of existing glyphs to create new ones.

__All credits & rights belong to the original author__. __AS SUCH, if you use this font for any purpose, you must send him a link to a free copy of your work at `johan.winge@telia.com` as he had stated in his webpage__.

## Modifications:
* Added new glyphs: `.nodef`, `{`, `}`, `•`
* Added ligatures: `<=`, `>=`, `->`, `<-`, `=>`
* Aligned & Adjusted: `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `:`, `|`, `[`, `]`, `_`

## Planned
* New glyphs: `FULL BOX-DRAWING SET!`, `ASSORTED MATHEMATICAL SYMBOLS`
* New Ligatures: `==`, `!=`, `->`, `<-`


_I hope you enjoy the font as much as I do._
